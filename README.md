**There may be several Wi-Fi scanners on the Google Play Store, but only one includes Material Design and modern technologies (hello Kotlin!).**

This is the Wi-Fi scanner you're looking for:
- get details about your WiFi connection (IPv6 compatible);
- find connected hosts on your WiFi network;
- scan WiFi networks around you.

This app is designed to run the best way possible on the latest version of Android. You won't find any ads, and that's cool: we respect your privacy.

Access to device location is required by the operating system: Android does not allow WiFi network scanning without this permission.
